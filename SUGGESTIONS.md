# Suggestions for Improvement

## 1. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The current implementation uses placeholder comments for authentication middleware. A more robust and secure approach would be to implement a full-fledged Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.

### Benefits:
*   **Enhanced Security:** granular control over who can access which resources and perform which actions.
*   **Flexibility:** easily add or modify roles and permissions as the application grows.
*   **Maintainability:** centralized access control logic makes the code easier to manage and audit.

### Implementation Steps:
1.  **Define Roles and Permissions:** Clearly define the roles (e.g., `admin`, `customer`) and the permissions associated with each role.
2.  **Create Middleware:** Implement a Gin middleware that extracts the user's role from the JWT token and checks if the role has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.
3.  **Apply Middleware to Routes:** Apply the middleware to the relevant route groups (e.g., `/admin`, `/cart`, `/orders`).

## 2. Secure JWT Secret Key

The JWT secret key is currently hardcoded in `handlers/auth.go`. This is a security risk. The secret key should be stored securely and not be checked into version control.

### Recommendation:
*   Use environment variables to store the JWT secret key. This allows you to have different keys for different environments (development, staging, production) and keeps the key out of the codebase. You can use a library like `godotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file during development.

## 3. Implement Full Order and Cart Logic

The current implementation of order and cart logic is simplified for demonstration purposes. A production-ready implementation should include:
*   Calculating the total price of an order based on the items in the cart.
*   Creating `OrderItem` entries for each product in the cart when an order is placed.
*   Clearing the cart after an order is placed.
*   More sophisticated order status management (e.g., preventing cancellation of shipped orders).

## 4. Input Validation

The current implementation relies on `ShouldBindJSON` for basic input validation. For a more robust solution, consider using a dedicated validation library like `go-playground/validator` to define and enforce more complex validation rules on incoming data. This will help prevent invalid data from being saved to the database and improve the overall security and stability of the application.
